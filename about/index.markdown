Currently, I work as a data scientist at [Proximus](https://www.proximus.be/), a major Belgian telecommunications company.

I am a free and open-source software enthousiast.

Some projects that I have been previously or currently working on:

* [Visualizing Belgian inflation data](https://rytis.shinyapps.io/inflation)
* [Mapping unemployment in the EU](https://github.com/rbagd/eu-unemployment)
* [`R`Â package `functionalIV`](https://github.com/rbagd/functionalIV) implementing various estimators for functional linear instrumental models. It's currently undergoing some refactoring.
* [Kalman filtering in Rust](https://github.com/rbagd/rust-linearkalman)
* [Dynamic factor model estimation](https://github.com/rbagd/dynfactoR) with `R`. A faster version with `C++` code for Kalman filtering and EM-algorithm steps is in progress.
