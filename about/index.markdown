I study econometrics at a graduate level in Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium.

I am also a free and open-source software enthousiast.

Some projects that I have been previously or currently working on:

* [Visualizing Belgian inflation data](https://rytis.shinyapps.io/inflation)
* [Mapping unemployment in the EU](https://github.com/rbagd/eu-unemployment)
* [`R` package `functionalIV`](https://github.com/rbagd/functionalIV) implementing various estimators for functional linear instrumental models

This website is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Its source code can be found [here](https://github.com/rbagd/rbagd.github.io).

If you appreciate the content and have a [Flattr](https://flattr.com) account, help by letting me know about it.
