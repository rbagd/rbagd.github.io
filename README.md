This is source code for my personal website and pseudo-blog generated by `Jekyll`. Feel free to improve it.

Here are some notes about the website:

* commenting is not enabled as I ruled out `Disqus` and other JavaScript-based commenting engines in the cloud out of respect for readers' privacy. Someday I may add a plugin for static comments. In the meanwhile, you are welcome to e-mail me instead or raise an issue on `GitHub`. For the former, you could even use [anonymous e-mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/).
